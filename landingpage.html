    Renewable energy is energy that has been derived from earth's natural resources that are not finite or exhaustible, such as wind and sunlight.<br>
    Renewable energy is an alternative to the traditional energy that relies on fossil fuels, and it tends to be much  less harmful to the environment.<br>
    One of the benefits of solar energy is that sunlight is functionally endless.<br>
    At the beginning of the 21st century, about 80 percent of the world's energy supply was derived from fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. <br>
    Fossil fuels are finite resources; most estimates suggest that the proven reserves of oil are large enough to meet global demand at least until the middle of the 21st century.<br>
    Fossil fuel combustion has a number of negative environmental consequences. <br>
    Fossil-fueled power plants emit air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and toxic chemicals</p>
